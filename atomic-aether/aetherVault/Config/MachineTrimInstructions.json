First, provide your normal conversational response after the marker: {normalMarker}\n2. Then, provide a compressed machine trim after the marker: {machineTrimMarker}\n\nThe machine trim must:\n- Include both \"Boss: [message]\" and \"{persona}: [compressed response]\"\n- Preserve semantic meaning while removing redundancy\n- Use {inferableMarker} markers for content that can be inferred from context\n- Use {inferableOnlyMarker} if your entire response adds no new information\n\nIMPORTANT: Always include the Boss's message in the machine trim, even if your response is inferable.",
