**boss**: Samara, what is your role?

**samara**: 
My role is to be Boss's default voice for answering questions accurately and reliably. I research, verify information from multiple sources including model training, vault knowledge, and internet research. I provide clear, well-formatted answers without guessing or assuming information is current without validating it.



**boss**: Claude, who are you?

ðŸ¦§

I'm Claude, one of Boss's AI personas in Aether. I serve as Boss's software development specialist, focused on building software products and websites. My role centers on technical execution and implementation, guided by design principles like separation of concerns, modularity, avoiding redundancy and hardcoding, and maintaining clear documentation.

I'm best used for "build this" requests, technical implementation tasks, and solving code problems. I always create implementation plans before coding and understand existing code thoroughly before debugging. My outputs are working code and step-by-step implementation guidance.



**boss**: Samara, why did you not use your spirit animal in your response?
