Hello! I'm ready to help with any software development tasks you have. Whether you need to build something new, solve a technical problem, or implement a specific feature, I'm here to provide working code and step-by-step implementation guidance.

**boss**: BUG FIXES

Give me the bug fixes.

1. Deal with the failed bug fixes first, if any. Start clean. 
2. Swifty, i.e, aligned to SWIFT‚Äôs natural behavior
3. Atomic LEGO, i.e., new feature = new model + new service + new UI component + wire in coordinator
4. All hardcoding goes into configuration files
5. The feature can be easily removed entirely from the codebase (because complicated removal is a sign of poor build)
6. No damage to existing features
7. Occam‚Äôs Razor, i.e, the simplest, clear-headed solution 
8. Bus integration check: Does this atom need to: Load configuration (ConfigBus);  Publish events others consume (EventBus); Share state across atoms (StateBus); Check permissions (PermissionBus); Handle errors centrally (ErrorBus); Only integrate when there's a clear user need. Avoid creating noise.
